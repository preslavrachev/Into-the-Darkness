#Into The Darkness

So, he simply stood there, looking into the darkness, pondering what to do next. It wasn't the first time he had to face this same door -  the door to his past; a lair of forgotten dreams and lost memories. He had stood there so many times before, looking at the door, touching the handle, giving up, then eventually going away. Yet, this time it was all different. He knew that all of this had to come to and end. He had to face his past!  There was just no other way around it.

A sudden rush of energy flew into his veins, he grabbed the door handle and got inside.

Fuck! Thanks same dream over and over again! Every time approaching the damn door from a distance, standing there, wondering whether to get inside. Like the dream he just woke up from, sometimes he convinced himself to enter; he knew in his heart that he had to do it. Yet, he never managed to to see beyond a tiny sliver of darkness. By the time the door opened, he was already awake, his mind gradually returning to his present state of misery.
