## What is this all about?
"Into the Darkness" is an attempt at collaborative creative writing over Github. It follows an idea of mine that people can combine forces to create a unique story (or maybe even a book, who knows) together. It's jus like building a complex software system, where everyone can contribute a patch, a bug fix, or a new feature. Here, everyone willing, can contribute a word, sentence, paragraph, page, or fork the story and give it a completely new direction.

## How does it work?
It's very simple. Fork this repositoy. Add your changes, and send me a pull request. That's it!

Due to the distributed nature of Git, though, not everyone's contributions can be added at the same time. Without a bit of moderation, it can easily turn from a collective writing effort, into a salad of random words.

Like in classical D&D games, I will play the role of a storyteller, and choose one of the submitted pull requests to integrate into the story. The rest of the contributors will have to sync their forks with the latest changes, and modify their submissions accordingly. 

Choosing how the story will continue at will does not only apply a moderate level of moderation in it. It will actually help your creativity, by giving it a direction. There has been research on creativity going on that says that creativty works best under time and space pressure. It tries to "break free" from the boundaries of the box, but this will only work if there is a box in the first place. 

That explains why I put a title and two sentences to the story. They will not necessarily stay the same, but will serve you as a direction in the beginning.

## How can one contribute?
As already explained: simply fork this repository, add your changes and send me a pull request

## Should I stick to the genre/title?
Not necessarily. I just wrote down the first thing that popped in my mind. It should serve you as a starting point, and give you a general direction, but nothing more. You are free to change everything, and as long as the changes are compelling, the direction of the whole story might change.
